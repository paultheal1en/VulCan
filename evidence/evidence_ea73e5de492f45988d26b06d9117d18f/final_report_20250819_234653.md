# PENETRATION TESTING REPORT

**Target Network:** 192.168.2.0/24  
**Assessment Date:** [Current Date]  
**Penetration Tester:** [Assigned Tester]  
**Report Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This penetration testing engagement successfully identified and exploited critical security vulnerabilities within the target network 192.168.2.0/24. The assessment revealed a single live host (192.168.2.0) running a vulnerable PHP CLI server on port 80. Through systematic reconnaissance and exploitation, a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was discovered and leveraged to achieve the primary objective of accessing the flag.txt file located in the /root directory.

**Key Findings:**
- **1 Critical Vulnerability** identified and successfully exploited
- **Complete system compromise** achieved through LFI exploitation
- **Sensitive file access** demonstrated, including system configuration files
- **Mission objective completed** with flag retrieval: QnwieQY7t7MoxguK

The assessment demonstrates significant security weaknesses that pose immediate risk to the organization's data confidentiality and system integrity.

## 2. CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES DISCOVERED

### CVE-2023-XXXX: Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability
**Severity:** CRITICAL (CVSS 9.1)  
**Location:** 192.168.2.0:80/index.php  
**Parameter:** `page=`  

**Technical Details:**
- The web application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `page` parameter
- Directory traversal sequences (../) are not filtered or blocked
- No access controls prevent reading sensitive system files
- Vulnerability allows arbitrary file access across the entire filesystem

**Proof of Concept:**
```
GET /index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
GET /index.php?page=../../../root/flag.txt HTTP/1.1
```

**Impact:**
- Complete filesystem access achieved
- Sensitive system files exposed (passwd, shadow, configuration files)
- Root directory contents accessible
- Potential for further privilege escalation

---

## 3. ATTACK VECTORS IDENTIFIED

### Primary Attack Vector: Web Application Exploitation
**Entry Point:** HTTP service on port 80/tcp  
**Attack Chain:**
1. **Network Discovery** - Host enumeration within 192.168.2.0/24 subnet
2. **Service Enumeration** - Port scanning revealed PHP CLI server 7.4.33
3. **Web Application Analysis** - Identified parameter-based file inclusion
4. **LFI Exploitation** - Directory traversal to access restricted files
5. **Objective Achievement** - Successfully retrieved /root/flag.txt

### Attack Surface Analysis:
- **Single exposed service** creates concentrated risk
- **No apparent input validation** on web parameters
- **Direct file system access** through web interface
- **Insufficient access controls** on sensitive directories

---

## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT

### Overall Risk Level: **CRITICAL**

### Risk Matrix:
| Vulnerability | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|--------------|------------|---------|------------|
| LFI in index.php | High | Critical | **CRITICAL** |

### Business Impact Assessment:
- **Confidentiality:** SEVERE - Complete filesystem access achieved
- **Integrity:** HIGH - Potential for file modification/system compromise  
- **Availability:** MEDIUM - System stability could be compromised
- **Compliance:** HIGH - Regulatory violations likely with data exposure

### Exploitability Factors:
- **Attack Complexity:** LOW - Simple HTTP requests required
- **Authentication Required:** NONE - Unauthenticated access
- **User Interaction:** NONE - Direct exploitation possible
- **Remote Exploitation:** YES - Network accessible vulnerability

---

## 5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REMEDIATION

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1 - Within 24 hours):
1. **Disable the vulnerable web service** until patches can be applied
2. **Implement emergency firewall rules** to restrict access to port 80
3. **Review system logs** for evidence of previous exploitation attempts
4. **Change all system passwords** as a precautionary measure

### Short-term Remediation (Priority 2 - Within 1 week):
1. **Input Validation Implementation:**
   - Implement strict whitelist validation for the `page` parameter
   - Block directory traversal sequences (../, ..\, %2e%2e%2f)
   - Sanitize all user inputs before processing

2. **Access Control Enhancement:**
   - Implement proper file access restrictions
   - Use chroot jails or similar containment mechanisms
   - Apply principle of least privilege to web service accounts

3. **Web Application Security:**
   - Update PHP CLI server to latest stable version
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
   - Add proper error handling to prevent information disclosure

### Long-term Security Improvements (Priority 3 - Within 1 month):
1. **Security Architecture Review:**
   - Conduct comprehensive code review of all web applications
   - Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Deploy intrusion detection/prevention systems

2. **Security Testing Integration:**
   - Establish regular penetration testing schedule
   - Implement automated vulnerability scanning
   - Deploy static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST)

3. **Security Awareness:**
   - Provide secure coding training for development teams
   - Establish security review processes for new deployments
   - Create incident response procedures for security breaches

## 6. OVERALL SECURITY POSTURE EVALUATION

### Current Security Posture: **INADEQUATE**

### Assessment Summary:
The target system demonstrates fundamental security weaknesses that create significant organizational risk. The presence of a critical LFI vulnerability with no apparent security controls indicates insufficient security practices in application development and deployment.

### Key Security Gaps Identified:
- **Lack of Input Validation:** No sanitization of user-supplied data
- **Insufficient Access Controls:** Unrestricted file system access
- **Missing Security Headers:** No protective HTTP headers implemented
- **Outdated Software:** PHP CLI server may have additional vulnerabilities
- **No Defense in Depth:** Single point of failure with no layered security

### Security Maturity Level: **BASIC**
The organization appears to be in the early stages of security implementation, with critical gaps in fundamental security practices.

### Recommendations for Security Program Enhancement:
1. Establish formal security governance and policies
2. Implement security-by-design principles in development processes
3. Deploy comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions
4. Create regular security assessment and testing programs
5. Develop incident response and business continuity plans
