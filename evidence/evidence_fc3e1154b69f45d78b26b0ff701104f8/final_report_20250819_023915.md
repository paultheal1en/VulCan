# PENETRATION TESTING REPORT

**Target Network:** 192.168.2.0/24  
**Assessment Date:** [Current Date]  
**Tester:** Security Assessment Team  
**Report Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This penetration testing engagement successfully identified and exploited critical security vulnerabilities within the target network 192.168.2.0/24. The assessment revealed a single target machine (192.168.2.0) hosting a PHP web application with severe security flaws that allowed complete compromise of sensitive data.

**Key Findings:**
- **1 Critical Vulnerability** identified and successfully exploited
- **Complete system compromise** achieved through Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- **Sensitive data extraction** accomplished, including the target flag file
- **Minimal attack surface** due to single open port, but inadequate security controls

The assessment demonstrates that despite a reduced attack surface, poor application security practices can lead to complete system compromise. Immediate remediation is required to address the critical vulnerability identified.

## 2. CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES DISCOVERED

### CVE Classification: Local File Inclusion (LFI)
**Severity:** CRITICAL (CVSS 9.1)  
**Location:** 192.168.2.0:80/index.php  
**Parameter:** `page`

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Component:** PHP CLI server 7.4.33 running web application
- **Application Path:** `/var/www/html/`
- **Vulnerable Code:** Direct file inclusion without input validation or sanitization
- **Error Disclosure:** Fatal PHP errors revealing internal application structure

**Exploitation Evidence:**
- Successfully accessed `/root/flag.txt` containing sensitive data
- Confirmed ability to read arbitrary system files
- Function redeclaration errors indicate unsanitized direct file inclusion
- Complete bypass of intended application functionality

---

## 3. ATTACK VECTORS IDENTIFIED

### Primary Attack Vector: Web Application Exploitation
**Entry Point:** HTTP service on port 80  
**Method:** Local File Inclusion via GET parameter manipulation

**Attack Chain:**
1. **Network Discovery:** Identified target machine at 192.168.2.0
2. **Service Enumeration:** Discovered HTTP service on port 80
3. **Application Analysis:** Identified PHP-based web application with parameter-based routing
4. **Vulnerability Discovery:** Confirmed LFI in `index.php?page` parameter
5. **Exploitation:** Successfully extracted sensitive files including `/root/flag.txt`

**Attack Complexity:** LOW  
**Required Privileges:** NONE  
**User Interaction:** NONE

## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT

### Overall Risk Level: **CRITICAL**

**Business Impact Assessment:**
- **Confidentiality:** CRITICAL - Sensitive system files and data accessible
- **Integrity:** HIGH - Potential for file system manipulation
- **Availability:** MEDIUM - Service disruption possible through malicious file inclusion

**Risk Factors:**
- **Exploitability:** Very High - Simple HTTP GET request exploitation
- **Attack Complexity:** Very Low - No authentication or special conditions required
- **Impact Scope:** Very High - Root-level file system access achieved
- **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Attacks easily logged but may go unnoticed without monitoring

**Likelihood of Exploitation:** VERY HIGH
- Vulnerability is easily discoverable through automated scanning
- Exploitation requires minimal technical skill
- No authentication barriers present
- Direct internet accessibility assumed

## 5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REMEDIATION

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1 - Within 24 Hours)
1. **Disable Vulnerable Application**
   - Take the web service offline immediately
   - Block access to port 80 until remediation is complete

2. **Emergency Patching**
   - Implement input validation for all user-supplied parameters
   - Remove direct file inclusion functionality

### Short-term Remediation (Priority 2 - Within 1 Week)
1. **Secure Code Implementation**
   - Implement whitelist-based file inclusion
   - Add proper input sanitization and validation
   - Remove error disclosure in production environment
   - Implement file path restrictions and chroot jail

2. **Security Controls**
   - Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring
   - Add rate limiting and request filtering

### Long-term Security Improvements (Priority 3 - Within 1 Month)
1. **Security Architecture**
   - Implement principle of least privilege
   - Separate web application from sensitive system files
   - Deploy defense-in-depth security controls

2. **Security Testing**
   - Establish regular penetration testing schedule
   - Implement automated vulnerability scanning
   - Conduct secure code reviews for all web applications

3. **Monitoring and Detection**
   - Deploy SIEM solution with LFI attack signatures
   - Implement file integrity monitoring
   - Establish incident response procedures

## 6. OVERALL SECURITY POSTURE EVALUATION

### Current Security Posture: **POOR**

**Strengths Identified:**
- Minimal attack surface with single open port
- Linux-based system architecture
- Service isolation (PHP CLI server)

**Critical Weaknesses:**
- Complete absence of input validation
- Insecure application development practices
- Lack of proper error handling
- No apparent security monitoring or logging
- Direct file system access from web application

### Security Maturity Assessment:
- **Application Security:** INADEQUATE
- **Network Security:** MINIMAL
- **Monitoring/Logging:** ABSENT
- **Incident Response:** UNKNOWN
- **Security Awareness:** POOR

### Recommendations for Security Program:
1. Establish formal secure development lifecycle (SDLC)
2. Implement comprehensive security testing program
3. Deploy continuous security monitoring solutions
4. Develop incident response and recovery procedures
5. Conduct regular security awareness training
