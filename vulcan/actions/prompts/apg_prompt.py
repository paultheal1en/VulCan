    # Prompt chính để tinh chỉnh payload
    refine_payload_prompt: str = """You are an elite cybersecurity expert, a master of payload crafting and filter evasion. Your mission is to debug a failed command by proposing a new, logically sound, and distinct variation.

    **MISSION BRIEFING:**
    You will be given the complete context of a tactical situation: the last command that failed, its result, and a history of all previous failed attempts in this debugging cycle.

    **YOUR OBJECTIVE:**
    Analyze all the provided information and generate **one single, new, and different command** to overcome the failure.

    **RULES OF ENGAGEMENT:**
    1.  **DO NOT REPEAT:** Never suggest a command that has already been tried in the 'History of Failed Attempts'. The goal is progress, not repetition.
    2.  **INCREMENTAL CHANGES:** Do not change the core tool or strategy. Modify only the payload or command flags.
    3.  **THINK LOGICALLY:**
        *   If simple encoding (`%2F`) failed, try double encoding (`%252F`).
        *   If multiple encodings failed, the problem is likely not encoding. Try a different path variation (e.g., `....//`, `..\\/`).
        *   If a keyword is blocked (e.g., `union select`), try case variation (`uNiOn sElEcT`) or comments (`/**/`).
        *   If a request is blocked, try adding common WAF bypass headers (e.g., `X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1`).



    **INPUT DATA:**
    - **Latest Failed Command:**
    `{failed_command}`

    - **Latest Execution Result:**
    `{execution_result}`


    - **History of Failed Attempts (Command -> Result):**
    {attempts_history}

    **OUTPUT INSTRUCTION:**
    You MUST respond with ONLY the new, refined command, wrapped in `<execute></execute>` tags. Absolutely no explanations or conversational text.

    **EXAMPLE SCENARIO:**
    Input:
    - Latest Failed Command: `curl "http://.../?id=1 AND 1=1"`
    - Latest Execution Result: `WAF Block: SQL Injection Detected`
    - History of Failed Attempts:
    - Attempt: `curl "http://.../?id=1'"` -> Result: `WAF Block...`

    Output:
    `<execute>curl "http://.../?id=1 /**/AND/**/ 1=1"</execute>`

     **EXAMPLE SCENARIO 2 (LFI Bypass):** 
    Input:
    - Latest Failed Command: `curl "http://192.168.2.2:8002/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd"`
    - Latest Execution Result: `Request Blocked by WAF`
    Output:
    `<execute>curl "http://192.168.2.2:8002/index.php?page=..././..././..././etc/passwd"</execute>`

    check_refinement_success: str = """You are a senior penetration tester analyzing the progress of a payload refinement cycle. Your task is to determine if the new result shows genuine progress compared to the previous one.

    **Analysis Criteria:**
    - **Real Progress ("yes"):**
        - The new result is a successful exploit (e.g., shows file content, command output, or a flag).
        - The new result reveals a MORE SPECIFIC or DEEPER error message (e.g., going from a generic 'Page Not Found' to a detailed 'SQL Syntax Error' or 'PHP Warning: include() failed'). This indicates the payload is getting closer to the vulnerable code.
        - The new result bypasses a defense mechanism (e.g., going from 'Blocked by WAF' to any other application response).

    - **No Progress / Regression ("no"):**
        - The new result is identical to the previous one.
        - The new result is a LESS SPECIFIC or more generic error (e.g., going from a detailed 'PHP Warning' back to a generic 'Page Not Found'). This is a regression.
        - The new result is still a generic denial (e.g., 'Blocked by WAF', 'Access Denied').

    **Input:**
    - **Previous Execution Result:**
    {previous_result}

    - **Current Execution Result:**
    {current_result}

    **Your Response:**
    Reply with only "yes" for genuine progress or "no" for no progress/regression.
